The first function getComputerChoice will return either rock, paper or
scissors when called.
In order to accomplish this, we need something random....
and return one of the choices in condition with random, or somehting like that


1. Declare and Initialize getComputerChoice function without any parameter input.
2.Initialize a 4th variable that stores a random number from 0-100.
3. if the 4th variable gets a number less than 33, return strin rock, if it is less than 66, return paper otherwise return scissors


The second function would be the function that plays the game when invoked, a single round. It accepts 2 parameters as arguments, the player
selection and computerchoice. It should return a string declaring the winner like, "You win! Paper beats rock.". Accounts ties by replaying
the round, and player selection should be case insensitive.

1. Declare and initialize the playRound() function, and inside the parenthesis, playerSelection and computerSelection.
2. playerSelection gets first converted to all small letters no matter how it was entered.
3. the computerSelection will store the value of getComputerChoice function.
4. Using the switch case, we will make conditions in case, for every case. Of if this does not turn out well, if else conditions.





BEGIN
    INIT getComputerChoice with no parameters

        SET randomChoice to generate random number between 1-100
        IF randomChoice returns 33 or less THEN
            return rock 
        ELSE IF randomChoice returns less than 66
            return paper
        ELSE return scissors

        END IF
    
    END function






END

The first function getComputerChoice will return either rock, paper or
scissors when called.
In order to accomplish this, we need something random....
and return one of the choices in condition with random, or somehting like that


1. Declare and Initialize getComputerChoice function without any parameter input.
2. Initialize 3 variables with rock, paper and scissors.
3. Initialize a 4th variable that stores a random number from 0-100.
4. if the 4th variable gets a number less than 33, return strin rock, if it is between 33 and 66, return paper otherwise return scissors




BEGIN
    INIT getComputerChoice with no parameters
        SET choice1 to rock
        SET choice2 to paper
        SET choice3 to scissors

        SET randomChoice to random number between 1-100

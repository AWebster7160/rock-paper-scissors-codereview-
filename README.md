# rock-paper-scissors

My third project from The Odin Project. This time it is to demonstrate my newly acquired scripting skillz and planning of code and writing algorithms.

The planning and alogorithms are going to be written probably written on a physical notebook otherwise I will create a new file in this repo...

The project at this stage is basically javascript syntax and logic to reproduce a rock paper scissors game on a web browser's console. The player will play with a randomly generated choice aka computer for 5 rounds maybe.

And last but not least will probably come back in the future to repolish and re-edit this piece as well after I acquire a much more higher level wizard abilities.
